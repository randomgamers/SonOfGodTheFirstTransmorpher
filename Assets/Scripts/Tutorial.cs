// Welcome to ???
// Finish the level as soon as possible. Start by tapping -> to run.
// You can always look at the left top corner for keys to be pressed.
// Watch the progress bar above to see the how far you already got.
// Good luck.

// So far pretty simple, right? Wait, look!
// There's a tree in front of you!
// Press 2 to bird.

// Different animals are controlled differently.
// Press UP and Down to fly.

// Great! But pay attention,
// there's a cloud in front of you!
// Press 1 to human (again).

// Neat! Now it's time for a little practice.

// You rule, but look, there's a cloud above this tree.
// Press 3 to snake.

// Nice! The snake is pretty difficult to control.
// Press UP, ->, DOWN, <-

// Wow, so cool! Now it's time to human again.
// Press 1 to human!

// You got it. Try few steps by yourself.

// OK, pretty good job.
// Look, there's a huge sea over there.
// You can't run on water right?
// Press either 2 to bird or 4 to jellyfish.
// You control the jellyfish by ->, <-.

// Well done, you passed the sea.
// Now get on the ground again.

// You almost finished the level!
// After a while you'll be able to play the real game.
// Tough levels are ahead, so brace yourself.
// P.S.: There are also some powerfull items to be picked.
